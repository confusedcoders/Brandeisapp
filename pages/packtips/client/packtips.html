<h4> One important tip is to pack in categories. When planing your trip, divide your items into categories such as clothes, hygiene, medicine, technology, food, makeup, toys etc. Pack them together in those categories in order to better keep track of said items.

By doing this, you can better keep track of specific items by associating them with more broad categories as opposed to having to keep track of every item's location. Here is a picture of items to pack and their categories </h4>
